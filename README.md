# Baldur's Gate 3 Spell Browser
A quick app I threw together to help me keep track of/analyze my spells in the video game Baldur's Gate 3. Data saves to localstorage. [Check it out here on CodeSandbox!](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/jessica-px/bg3-spell-browser)

## Todo
- [ ] Enter data for remaining spells
- [ ] Add filterable field for damage type
- [ ] Add filterable field for applied conditions (with hoverable tooltips explaining how that condition works)
- [ ] Character name filter doesn't update with edit form, feels buggy
